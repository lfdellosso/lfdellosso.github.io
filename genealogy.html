My genealogical research began in 1992 when I made the first of four (as of 2012) trips to Bernalda, Italy. Upon my return to the US, I compiled the first of many Dell'Osso ancestral family trees. The expertise and friendship of Maestro Antonio Salfi has been, and continues to be, invaluable in finding, translating, and interpreting the genealogical documents (written in either Italian or Latin). Finally, I must thank: Don Mariano and Don Pepino for making the baptismal, marriage, and death records of the Church available to me; the office of the Mayor and city officials of Bernalda [administrations of Angelo Gabriele Tataranno, Giuseppe Pesare, Francesco Antonio Renna, Maria Rita Iaculli, and Leonardo Chiruzzi] for making the birth, marriage, and death records of the city available to me; and the people of Bernalda, especially Rosa Parisi, for their helpfulness and the information about the history of Bernalda and of the Dell'Osso family that they provided.<br><br>In addition to downloadable files containing Dell'Osso family trees in various forms (e.g., pedigree/ancestral, descendant, and relative), this site will contain links to information about Bernalda, short vignettes of my findings and impressions of Bernalda, and additional information about members of the Dell'Osso family.</P> <center><imgsrc="Genealogy/Bernalda/BernaldaSeal.jpg"> <br><P><font size="3"><font size="4"><font color="#580000"><b>Bernalda, Basilicata, Italy</b></font color></font><img--><br><br><imgsrc="Genealogy/Bernalda/Bernalda_18Century.jpg"> <img  src="Genealogy/Bernalda/Bernalda_s.jpg"> <img src="Genealogy/Bernalda/OldHouse_s.jpg"></center><br><left> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVIII Century Bernalda and XV Century Castello Aragonese &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXI Century Bernalda and "Il Castello" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Typical Bernaldese House, circa 1800's <P><left><font size="3">The history of Bernalda, going back to the tenth century, and the contributions to its growth and governance made by 19 members of the Dell'Osso family are documented in the book, <font color="#009900"><u>Storia di Camarda e di Bernalda</u>,</font color> by Bernardino Giuseppe d'Angela. The author describes the Dell'Osso family as one of the three early families that were, <font color="#009900">"veramente ricche"</font color> (very rich). Another historical document described them as <font color="#009900">"una nobile famiglia bernaldese"</font color> (a noble bernaldese family). In the original part of Bernalda, there is a street now called, <font color="#009900">"Via Antica"</font color> but whose original name was, <font color="#009900">"Strada Dell'Osso"</font color> and is still referred to as <font color="#009900">"Via di Dell'Osso"</font color> by the locals. It was on this street that the extended family resided in a villa and surrounding houses. The Dell'Osso family maintained their influence by having members in areas of the law, the church, and city administration. They served as notaries, city council members, and clergy. Four Dell'Ossos served as mayors of Bernalda (the most famous, Cav. Dott. Luigi Dell'Osso served two terms as mayor, 1877-1883 and 1897-1901), and six as priests (Rev. Don Luigi, Rev. Don Bernardino, Rev. Don Francesco Antonio, Rev. Don Giovanni Bernardino, Rev. Don Domenico Antonio, and my grandfather, Rev. Don Luigi) including three who rose to the rank of arch priest. There was also the nun, Suora Maria Teressa.<br><br>In another book, <font color="#009900"><u>Vivurr&egrave;</u>,</font color> Angelo Tataranno documents the key roles played by Dott. Luigi Dell'Osso, Dott. Camillo Dell'Osso, Francesco Dell'Osso, and Gaetano Dell'Osso in the historical events of April 8, 1888. In, <font color="#009900"><u>Dizionario dei Patrioti Lucani</u> da T. Pedio,</font color> the arrests of the brothers Filippo and Francesco Dell'Osso and their subsequent pardons are documented. The pamphlets, <font color="#009900"><u>I Fondatori della Societ&agrave; Operaia di Mutuo Soccorso di Bernalda</u> da Angelo Tataranno</font color> and <font color="#009900"><u>Memorie della Societ&agrave; Operaia di Mutuo Soccorso di Bernalda Luigi Dell'Osso - Angelo Lorito 1879 - 2001</u> da Angelo Tataranno</font color> document the founding by Luigi Dell'Osso and history of this Bernaldese society.<br><br>If you can read Itialian and are interested in the contributions of the Dell'Osso family to the history of Bernalda and Italy itseelf, I recommend reading these works. I have translated each passage mentioning a member of the Dell'Osso family from both the above books and from some other documents I have uncovered.<font color="#FF0000"> These are fascinating and surprising tid-bits about some of our ancestors and I highly recommend that all family members read them.</font color></left><br><center><font color="#FF0000">NEW!

The Y-chromosome results of the Dell'Osso family belong to the DNA haplogroup E1b1b1 (M35); this is comprised of <b>M168</b> > <b>YAP</b> > <b>M96</b> > P147 > P177 > P2 > M215 > <b>M35.</b></left><br><br><center><img src="Genealogy/DNA_Data/DNAMigrationRoute.png"></center><br><br><left> "Today, the E1b1b1 line of descent is most heavily represented in Mediterranean populations. Approximately 10 percent of the men in Spain belong to this haplogroup, as do 12 percent of the men in northern Italy, and 13 percent of the men in central and southern Italy. Roughly 20 percent of the men in Sicily belong to this group. In the Balkans and Greece, between 20 to 30 percent of the men belong to E1b1b1, as to nearly 75 percent of the men in North Africa. The haplpgroup is rarely found in India or East Asia. Around 10 percent of all European men trace their descent to this line. For example, in Ireland, 3 to 4 percent of the men belong, in England, 4 to 5 percent, Hungary, 7 percent, and Poland, 8 to 9 percent. Nearly 25 percent of Jewish men belong to this haplogroup."

Dell'Osso) To download the complete report, <a href="Genealogy/DNA Data/DNA_Dell'Osso.pdf" target="_blank">Click Here.</a><br><br> A better understanding of the above paragraph requires one to understand that although only 25 percent of Jewish men belong to this haplogroup today, many of those listed from northern Italy, southern Italy, Sicily, and perhaps even Spain, the Balkans, and Greece may also have originally been Jewish and were forced to convert to Catholicism either in Spain or after they were expelled to these regions. Thus, it is likely that this haplogroup included more men of Jewish origin.</P><P><center><font size="4"><br><font color="#580000"><b>History of the Dell'Osso Family's Origins</b><br>(Who were the Dell'Ossos? Where did they come from? Were they really nobility?)</font color></font size></center><br><br>In my research, I have tried to answer the above questions about the geographical, ethnic, economic, and social origins of the Dell'Osso family. We know that they appeared in Bernalda before the late 1600's (i.e., 1500 - 1650) and were already wealthy (they built 'palazzo/casa Dell'Osso' on 'Strada Dell'Osso'). We know they were well-educated and powerful in Bernalda society (they held high political, administrative, and clerical positions, prominant members were addressed as "Don," "Magnifico," "Dottore," and "Cavaliere," and they intermarried with other rich and powerful bernaldese citizens). Were they part of the 'nobility' accompanying the Spanish rulers during the time of King Alfonso II or perhaps, close associates or employees of the Spanish nobility? Although they were Catholic and had many members who became priests or archpriests, were they originally people of Jewish background who were either forced to convert during the time of the Spanish inquisition or voluntarily converted before or afterwards?<br><br>Geographically, their roots appear to lie in Spain both because of the timing of their arrival and the Spanish first names they used. Indeed, the story that our ancesters came from Spain has been carried down through many generations of different branches of the Dell'Osso family, now living in different countries. Perhaps "Dell'Osso" is a Spanish name where "Dell" means "of the" and "Osso" means "bone." Howeveer, the "Dell" may refer to their city of origin, as in "from;"this was a common practice. It is interesting to note that there are two towns in northern Spain called "Osso;" one is now called "Osso de Cinca" and the other, "Oss&oacute de Si&oacute." [<i>Note: There is also a town in southern Spain called, "Ossa de Montiel" which may be the place of origin of the family "De La Ossa" who emigrated from Spain (probably through Mexico and then moved north) to settle in Encino, California.</i>] Research into the Dell'Osso family branch of San Lucido and Roggiano Gravina goes back to Francesco (1700 - 1745) and also uncovered an original family of San Lucido with the name, "Osso" that later became, "L'Osso" and then, "Dell'Osso." The name, "Dell'Osso" appears in different forms, both within Italy and in the U.S. In addition to the forms listed above, "DellOsso," "Dell'osso," "dell'Osso." "Dellosso," "Del Losso," "De Losso," "Di Losso," "Dilossi," "DiLossi," and "DeLose," were used and may be found in various documents.The connection between the Dell'Osso branches in San Lucido and Bernalda has not been determined at this time. However, like the Bernalda branch, they were well educated, wealthy, and were notaries, priests, etc. <br><br>There are many possibilities regarding whether this was one family or several families who emigrated from Spain. Also, it is unclear how the Bernaldese Dell'Osso family arrived there. They could have sailed from Spain (e.g., Barcelona) to Rome, where they sought Converso acceptance (see below). From Rome, they could have sailed to San Lucido with those who settled in San Lucido and went overland to Bernalda or they could have sailed from Rome to Taranto, which is closer to Bernalda.<br><br>Economically the source of the Dell'Osso wealth remains unanswered but may stem from either their high political/administrative positions and education or their possible nobility. If the former, the question of their ethnic background needs further research. If the latter, they probably were originally Catholics either from Spain or Italy. The question of nobility is a murky one, especially in Italy where there historically were several "kingdoms," both internally and externally, due to conquest. To date, I have found no records of a truly noble (i.e., by directive of the king) family with the name "Dell'Osso." In Italy, it was common to bestow local 'nobility' onto individuals or families who, by virtue of their wealth and contributions to the society earned them that title in the eyes of their fellow citizens; that appears to be the reason for the description of the Dell'Ossos as <font color="#009900">"una nobile famiglia bernaldese"</font color>. Similarly, no <i>bone fide</i> coat of arms seems to exist, despite some which are commercially available. Finally, there are Dell'Osso families in the western United States who may or may not be directly related to those from Bernalda; I have not researched that branch.<br><br>Dell'Osso is a very rare name; I have found no such name in lists of Medieval surnames of either Italy or Spain. Nor is Dell'Osso listed as a Marrano surname (Spain) or a medieval surname of Italians of Jewish origin. There is one story that has been related to me that may explain this lack of either Marrano or Italian Jewish surnames. According to this story, the "De La Ossa" family was expelled from Spain during the Inquisition of 1492 and settled in or near Rome, Italy. In the 1600's  they petitioned the Vatican for acceptance as Conversos but the Roman Catholic Church refused to accept the "Dell'Osso" family. The family then fled to what is now southern Italy (e.g., Bernalda, San Lucido, and Roggiano Gravina) and converted to Catholicism; their prominance in the Catholic church of Bernalda certainly attests to their complete acceptance of and by the church. At present, this remains a family story for which I have seen no documentation. It is very interesting however, that the Sephardic Jewish practice of namimg the firts-born son afer the paternal grandfather, the first-born daughter after the paternal grandmother, etc. was used in the Dell'Osso family for many genreations, continuing to the current generation in my branch. Also, Francesco Dell'Osso (1700 - 1745) of San Lucido named his son "Giosue" from the Hebrew "Joshua." I continue to search for the origin of the Dell'Osso family and the connection between the Bernalda and San Lucido branches; I welcome any information that would help to document either.<br><br>Tracing the Dell'Osso lineage backwards from the information I have at present (circa late 1500's) can best be done using Italian church records (baptismal, marriage, and death) or Spanish ships manifests to determine if, when, and where they left Spain (perhaps Barcelona or ???) and arrived in Italy (possibly Rome, if the above story is correct, or either Naples, San Lucido, or Taranto, if they went directly to southern Italy). One thing that is currently unknown is the Jewish surname they used in Spain; that is most likely to be found via ship manifests or in the Vatican library with other appeals for Converso acceptance.<br><br><font color="#FF0000"><i>If there is anyone, be they a Dell'Osso, associated with the Catholic church, or a student of Italian or Spanish history, who can either help me obtain permission to search church records or ships' manifests or who has any information (documented or not) bearing on these questions of Dell'Osso origin or status, please contact me. </i></font color><a href="mailto:lfdo@att.net">(E-Mail: LF Dell'Osso)</a><P><P><center><font size="4"><br><font size="4"><font color="#580000"><b>Researching the Ancestral Roots of the Dell'Osso Family Tree</b></font color><br><font color="#FF0000">*** We are who they were ***</font color><br><font color="#009900">*** [Siamo chi erano] ***</font color></font><br><br><img src="Genealogy/RootsResearch/Lou.jpg"> <img src="Genealogy/RootsResearch/Antonio.jpg"> <img src="Genealogy/RootsResearch/LouAntonio1.jpg"><br> Lou and Antonio searching the records for members of the Dell'Osso family<br><img src="Genealogy/RootsResearch/LouAntonio2.jpg"> <img src="Genealogy/RootsResearch/LouAntonio4.jpg"> <img src="Genealogy/RootsResearch/LouAntonio3.jpg"><br> The Maestro (Antonio) finding a member and explaining his place in the family</p><br><font size="2"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></font><br><P><font size="4"><font color="#580000"><b>Family Trees</b></font color></font><br><br><img border="10" src="common_images/lfd_fam_tree.jpg" width="912" height="228" /></center><font size="3"><left><br><br>The family trees available on this web site were originally made using Reunion v 9.07 on a Mac computer (earlier versions (circa 1992 - 2002) made using Family Tree Maker, were imported into Reunion.
