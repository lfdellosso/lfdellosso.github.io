He covered the field rapidly and with purpose, was responsive to commands, located and pointed his two birds, and retrieved them to my hand after they were flushed and shot.

It fell in the pond near the far shore. Copper began the long swim straight at the fallen bird. After reaching the bird, he fetched it and turned to head back. He swam straight back towards me, walked up the bank and brought it to my hand. Second Bird: As I shot, it turned 180 degrees back behind the trees; I tried to shoot through the trees but did not hit it. Copper didn't get a chance at a second retrieve. <br><center><br><img src="FieldTrials/CprWT/CprWT1_s.jpg"><img src="FieldTrials/CprWT/CprWT2_s.jpg"><img src="FieldTrials/CprWT/CprWT3_s.jpg"><img src="FieldTrials/CprWT/CprWT4_s.jpg"><br><center> <== Copper Water Trial (1st Bird): Steady to Wing & Shot ==></center><br><br><img src="FieldTrials/CprWT/CprWT5_s.jpg"><img src="FieldTrials/CprWT/CprWT6_s.jpg"><img src="FieldTrials/CprWT/CprWT7_s.jpg"><img src="FieldTrials/CprWT/CprWT8_s.jpg"><br><center> <== Copper Water Trial (1st Bird): Long Water Retrieve to Hand ==></center><br><br><img src="FieldTrials/CprWT/CprWT9_s.jpg"><img src="FieldTrials/CprWT/CprWT10_s.jpg"><img src="FieldTrials/CprWT/CprWT11_s.jpg"><br><center> <== Copper Water Trial (1st Bird): Long Water Retrieve to Hand.

It fell on land, only 10 yards from Lakota. Lakota remained steady despite the temptation until told to fetch; he fetched to hand. Second Bird: Although shot over the pond, it flew overland, across the road and landed out of sight in the field used for Field Trials. Lakota was sent on a blind retrieve; he didn't see where the bird fell and I couldn't see or guide him even if I had seen it. He located the spot where the bird fell in the field, followed the scent trail, and chased down the running rooster. He subdued it, fetched it, and brought it across the field, under the fence, across the road, and to my hand. Lakota showed that he has the same tenacious desire and ability to find and return wounded game as Copper; that will be invaluable in the field. He took third place without even getting his feet wet. <br><center><br><img src="FieldTrials/LakWT/LakWT1_s.jpg"><img src="FieldTrials/LakWT/LakWT2_s.jpg"><img src="FieldTrials/LakWT/LakWT3_s.jpg"><img src="FieldTrials/LakWT/LakWT4_s.jpg"><br><center> <== Lakota Water Trial (1st Bird): Steady to Wing, Shot, & Fall; Retrieve to Hand ==></center><br><br><img src="FieldTrials/LakWT/LakWT5_s.jpg"><img src="FieldTrials/LakWT/LakWT6_s.jpg"><img src="FieldTrials/LakWT/LakWT7_s.jpg"><img src="FieldTrials/LakWT/LakWT8_s.jpg"><br><center> <== Lakota Water Trial (2nd Bird): Steady to Wing, Shot, & Fall; Long, Blind Retrieve to Hand ==></center><br><br><img src="FieldTrials/LakWT/LakWT9_s.jpg"><img src="FieldTrials/LakWT/LakWT10_s.jpg"><img src="FieldTrials/LakWT/LakWT11_s.jpg"><img src="FieldTrials/LakWT/LakWT12_s.jpg"><br><center> <== Lakota Water Trial (2nd Bird): Steady to Wing, Shot, & Fall; Long, Blind Retrieve to Hand ==></center><br><br><img src="FieldTrials/LakWT/LakWT13_s.jpg"><br><center> Lakota Water Trial: An Impressive Debut </center><br><b>2006-2007 Field Trial Results</b><br>Copper- 3 2nd, 2 3rd <==> Lakota- 3 1st; 3 2nd; 4 3rd<br><b>2006-2007 Water Trial Results</b><br>Lakota- 1 2nd; 1 3rd<br> After 12 years of field trial competition and qualifying for 13 straight Winners Trials, Copper officially retired.
